## Public Reports

As part of [our work with the Open Technology Fund](https://isecpartners.github.io/2013/10/14/open-tech-fund-report-release.html), some of the audits we produce are publicly available in full.  These documents have not been redacted in any way, excepting removing personal contact information of individuals involved.  While the majority of the work we do is private, we're happy to be able to both help projects that promote human rights and open societies and showcase the type of work we conduct day-in and day-out.
